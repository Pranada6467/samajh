# Text path on the `dev` set, model `anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5`

Run at 2026-11-10T05:38:17+00:00. Development set: 20 hand-written calls (5 each hi, hi-en, ta, kn), typed text, one author for replies, gold and prompt. Tamil and Kannada not human-reviewed. Gold verdicts and flags are the rule engine run on the hand-labelled extraction. Used for prompt iteration, so these numbers are in-sample.

False clear: gold is flag_for_review or unclear_needs_human and the pipeline says clear (n = calls whose gold is not clear). False alarm: gold is clear and the pipeline does not say clear (n = calls whose gold is clear). Extractor errors: 0. Last row: the rule engine on the set's gold extraction, so any miss there is not the extractor's.

## Verdicts, gold against pipeline (all calls)

| gold | pipeline | calls |
|---|---|---|
| clear | clear | 7 |
| flag_for_review | flag_for_review | 12 |
| unclear_needs_human | unclear_needs_human | 1 |

## Spans and grounding

- Spans the model copied (amounts, durations, recall items, claims, concerns) that were not in the reply: 0 of 105 (0.00%). By field: none.
- Answers whose clause numbers were missing or out of range: 0 of 170 (0.00%). By field: none.
- Both kinds are dropped to `unclear` (answers) or left for the rule engine to record as an evidence gap (recall items, claims, concerns). None is kept as an answer.
- Answers marked stated with no value or no span, kept as unclear: 0. By field: none.
- Gaps the rule engine raised with reason `quote_not_grounded`: 0 (with the gold extraction: 0).
- Gaps with reason `value_not_parsed`: 0 (with the gold extraction: 0).
- Record values found in bot turns shown to the model: premium in a `readback` question: 16. A lexical check of the premium, cover, sanctioned and disbursed amounts (digits and spoken form) and the provider name. A read-back repeats the amount the customer said, so it shows the record's premium whenever the customer's amount equals it. The two identity checks are never sent.

## Cost and latency

- LLM calls: 403 for 20 calls (11 served from the cache in this run).
- Spent in this run: $0.09769.
- Cost of these calls with nothing cached: $0.10039 ($0.00502 per transcript, $0.00025 per LLM call).
- Latency per LLM call when first made: median 1.04 s, p90 1.89 s (wall time of the client call, retries included, one network).

## Failures

### ta-05 (ta): gold `flag_for_review`, pipeline `flag_for_review`
Scenario: wrong cover and term; three sale concerns, one voiced at the close
- field `consent_given`: gold `('unclear', None)`, pipeline `('dont_know', None)`
  - turn 29 [consent] bot: "கடன் வாங்கும்போது நீங்கள் எதையெல்லாம் வாங்க ஒப்புக்கொண்டீர்கள், எப்படி ஒப்புக்கொண்டீர்கள்?" customer: "ஏஜென்ட் டேப்லெட்ல அழுத்த சொன்னார், அழுத்தினேன், எதுக்குன்னு சொல்லலை."
  - pipeline kept: "ஏஜென்ட் டேப்லெட்ல அழுத்த சொன்னார், அழுத்தினேன், எதுக்குன்னு சொல்லலை." (turn 29)
- flag not in gold: `consent` on P1: customer said they do not know | quote: "ஏஜென்ட் டேப்லெட்ல அழுத்த சொன்னார், அழுத்தினேன், எதுக்குன்னு சொல்லலை."
