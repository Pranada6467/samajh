    """The one rupee amount named in `text`, in any of the four call languages.

    Language-agnostic: digits (ASCII or native), number words in Devanagari, Latin, Tamil
    and Kannada script, and Prisma's inverse-text-normalised shape where a fraction word is
    left in front of the digits ("सवा 2,00,000" = 2,25,000). Never guesses: anything other
    than exactly one amount is `Ambiguous` or `NoAmount`.

    Several numbers in one text. A candidate is WEAK when it is under 100 and has neither a
    unit word nor a currency marker next to it ("एक FD", "बता दो", "दो तीन बार"). Rule:
      * a weak number directly before a noun of occurrence ("एक बार", "दो बार", "one time",
        "ஒரு தடவை", "ಒಂದು ಸಲ"; "एक ही बार" too), or a lone word "one" before an ordinary word
        ("एक पॉलिसी", "one policy"), counts that word. It never joins the amount before it
        ("पचास हज़ार एक बार" is 50,000) and is ignored after an amount unless a connector or
        negator joins them. So "पचास हज़ार एक FD" and "पचास हज़ार एक दिए" are 50,000: after a unit
        word, 50,001 is read only when a currency word or nothing follows the one;
      * exactly one distinct strong value -> `Parsed`; a weak candidate is ignored only when
        at least one ordinary word separates it from the strong one. With nothing, only
        punctuation, or only connectors/negators between them ("50 से 60 हज़ार", "बावन या
        पचपन हज़ार", "बावन हज़ार नहीं पचपन") the weak one counts and the result is `Ambiguous`,
        and so does a weak one with a negator directly before it ("बावन हज़ार था, नहीं पचपन");
      * the same value repeated counts once;
      * a strong candidate that cannot be read -> `Ambiguous` with its reason;
      * only weak candidates: one distinct value -> `Ambiguous(bare_number)`, a number that
        may not be an amount at all ("बावन", "पैसे दे दो"); several -> `multiple_amounts`;
      * anything else with candidates -> `Ambiguous(multiple_amounts)`.
    A candidate is `Ambiguous(malformed)`, and still listed, when a negator follows it
    ("पचास हज़ार नहीं था"), "not"/"no" precedes it, or it is compared ("पचास हज़ार से कम",
    "less than 50,000"). For a counted candidate this holds anywhere in the same clause
    ("बावन हज़ार तो नहीं था", "it was never 52,000"); a clause ends at punctuation. A text with
    a word of doubt or correction ("शायद", "सॉरी", "maybe") or a romanised Hindi number or
    fraction word ("saadhe", "paanch", "sau") is `Ambiguous(malformed)`. A unit word with no number ("हज़ार रुपये") is one unit at the start,
    after punctuation, a currency marker or a word the lexicon knows; directly after an
    unknown word ("साथ हज़ार", "कई लाख", "bavan hazaar") it is `Ambiguous(malformed)`,
    because that word may be the number. A bare plural unit ("lakhs of rupees") is too.
    A Tamil or Kannada noun in the ablative ("கணக்கிலிருந்து ஆயிரம்", "ಖಾತೆಯಿಂದ ಸಾವಿರ") is not
    a number, so the unit after it is one unit. An unknown word between an amount and its
    currency word ("पचास हज़ार पांसौ रुपये") may be the rest of the number: `Ambiguous(malformed)`.
    So is a half that "and" did not join to a number ("वन एंड द हाफ क्रोर"), and a number of
    1,000 or more on a thousand or lakh word ("6,13,00,020 थाउज़ंड").
    Prisma v2.5 also leaves lower groups as words after formatted higher groups: "5,00,000
    दो सौ" is 5,00,200 when the digits are whole thousands, lakhs or crores and the words carry
    a unit and fit below them; "5,00,000 दो" and "1,00,000 50,000" are `Ambiguous`.
    A number directly followed by a duration unit ("5 साल") or a percent sign is not a
    candidate. A fraction word by itself that is also an everyday word (கால், ಕಾಲು, half),
    and the Tamil ஒரு and ஒரே by themselves, are not candidates.

    `exact=True` is for a short quote that should be the amount and nothing else: the result
    is `Parsed` only when everything outside `Parsed.span` is whitespace, punctuation or a
    currency marker or word. Any other word or number gives `Ambiguous(malformed)` with the
    amount as the one candidate. In the default mode an unknown word in front of a complete
    number ("पक्का दो लाख") is not noticed; `exact=True` is what catches it.

    Not handled: romanised Hindi number words are out of scope. The common ones are refused
    wherever they stand; one that is not in the lexicon is refused only directly before a
    unit word. A bare number after a lakh or crore is read literally ("एक लाख बीस" is
    1,00,020), though in speech it often means 1,20,000: the read-back is the check. Tamil and Kannada numbers carrying a
    case ending are reported `Ambiguous(malformed)`, not read. Refused on purpose, because the
    text alone does not decide them: a number word directly before digits ("नाइंटी ₹1,80,000"
    was 90,80,000 and "नाइंटी ₹4,13,000" was 94,13,000 in Prisma v2.5 output), a clock time
    before an amount ("08:30 100": साढ़े आठ सौ, or 100 at half past eight), Kannada ಒಂದು ಕಾಲು /
    ಒಂದು ಮುಕ್ಕಾಲು before a unit (ಒಂದು is "one" and "a"), and "3/4" before a unit. Digits that
    Prisma formatted wrongly but well ("3,02,000" for 3,00,200) cannot be seen here at all:
    compare two readings with `cross_check`, and read the amount back.
